# Runes Mock Bridge

This project is an open-source proof of concept implementing a Runes Mock Bridge. The primary goal is to allow users to etch (and eventually mint) Runes on the Bitcoin network and create a 1:1 representation of these Runes as ERC1155 tokens (Non fungible initially) on the Rootstock (RSK) network, manage the runes in the RSK network, and then take it back to BTC.





## Getting Started
